# DeciMojo

A fixed-point decimal mathematics library for [the Mojo programming language üî•](https://www.modular.com/mojo).

**[‰∏≠Êñá¬∑Êº¢Â≠ó¬ª](./docs/readme_zht.md)**

## Overview

DeciMojo offers a complete fixed-precision decimal mathematics implementation for Mojo, providing exact calculations for financial modeling, scientific computing, and any application where floating-point approximation errors are unacceptable. Beyond basic arithmetic, DeciMojo delivers advanced mathematical functions with guaranteed precision.

### Current Implementation

- **Decimal**: A 128-bit fixed-point decimal type supporting up to 29 significant digits with a maximum of 28 decimal places[^fixed_precision], featuring comprehensive mathematical functions including logarithms, exponentiation, roots, and more.

### Future Roadmap

- **BigInt**: Arbitrary-precision integer type with unlimited digits
- **BigDecimal**: Arbitrary-precision decimal type with configurable precision[^arbitrary_precision]
- **BigComplex**: Arbitrary-precision complex number type built on BigDecimal

## Installation

DeciMojo can be directly added to your project environment by typing `magic add decimojo` in the Modular CLI. This command fetches the latest version of DeciMojo and makes it available for import in your Mojo project.

To use DeciMojo, import the necessary components from the `decimojo.prelude` module. This module provides convenient access to the most commonly used classes and functions, including `dm` (an alias for the `decimojo` module itself), `Decimal` and `RoundingMode`.

```mojo
from decimojo.prelude import dm, Decimal, RoundingMode

fn main() raises:
    var r = Decimal("3")           # radius
    var pi = Decimal("3.1415926")  # pi
    var area = pi * r * r          # area of a circle
    print(area)                    # 28.2743334
```

The Github repo of the project is at [https://github.com/forfudan/decimojo](https://github.com/forfudan/decimojo).

## Examples

The `Decimal` type can represent values with up to 29 significant digits and a maximum of 28 digits after the decimal point. When a value exceeds the maximum representable value (`2^96 - 1`), DeciMojo either raises an error or rounds the value to fit within these constraints. For example, the significant digits of `8.8888888888888888888888888888` (29 eights total with 28 after the decimal point) exceeds the maximum representable value (`2^96 - 1`) and is automatically rounded to `8.888888888888888888888888889` (28 eights total with 27 after the decimal point).

Here are 8 key examples highlighting the most important features of the `Decimal` type in its current state:

### 1. Fixed-Point Precision for Financial Calculations

```mojo
from decimojo import dm, Decimal

# The classic floating-point problem
print(0.1 + 0.2)  # 0.30000000000000004 (not exactly 0.3)

# Decimal solves this with exact representation
var d1 = Decimal("0.1")
var d2 = Decimal("0.2")
var sum = d1 + d2
print(sum)  # Exactly 0.3

# Financial calculation example - computing tax
var price = Decimal("19.99")
var tax_rate = Decimal("0.0725")
var tax = price * tax_rate  # Exactly 1.449275
var total = price + tax     # Exactly 21.439275
```

### 2. Basic Arithmetic with Proper Banker's Rounding

```mojo
# Addition with different scales
var a = Decimal("123.45")
var b = Decimal("67.8")
print(a + b)  # 191.25 (preserves highest precision)

# Subtraction with negative result
var c = Decimal("50")
var d = Decimal("75.25")
print(c - d)  # -25.25

# Multiplication with banker's rounding (round to even)
var e = Decimal("12.345")
var f = Decimal("5.67")
print(round(e * f, 2))  # 69.96 (rounds to nearest even)

# Division with banker's rounding
var g = Decimal("10")
var h = Decimal("3")
print(round(g / h, 2))  # 3.33 (rounded banker's style)
```

### 3. Scale and Precision Management

```mojo
# Scale refers to number of decimal places
var d1 = Decimal("123.45")
print(d1.scale())  # 2

# Precision control with explicit rounding
var d2 = Decimal("123.456")
print(d2.round_to_scale(1))  # 123.5 (banker's rounding)

# High precision is preserved (up to 28 decimal places)
var precise = Decimal("0.1234567890123456789012345678")
print(precise)  # 0.1234567890123456789012345678
```

### 4. Sign Handling and Absolute Value

```mojo
# Negation operator
var pos = Decimal("123.45")
var neg = -pos
print(neg)  # -123.45

# Absolute value
var abs_val = abs(Decimal("-987.65"))
print(abs_val)  # 987.65

# Sign checking
print(Decimal("-123.45").is_negative())  # True
print(Decimal("0").is_negative())        # False

# Sign preservation in multiplication
print(Decimal("-5") * Decimal("3"))      # -15 
print(Decimal("-5") * Decimal("-3"))     # 15
```

### 5. Advanced Mathematical Operations

```mojo
# Highly accurate square root implementation
var root2 = Decimal("2").sqrt()
print(root2)  # 1.4142135623730950488016887242

# Square root of imperfect squares
var root_15_9999 = Decimal("15.9999").sqrt()
print(root_15_9999)  # 3.9999874999804686889646053305

# Integer powers with fast binary exponentiation
var cubed = Decimal("3") ** 3
print(cubed)  # 27

# Negative powers (reciprocals)
var recip = Decimal("2") ** (-1)
print(recip)  # 0.5
```

### 6. Robust Edge Case Handling

```mojo
# Division by zero is properly caught
try:
    var result = Decimal("10") / Decimal("0")
except:
    print("Division by zero properly detected")

# Zero raised to negative power
try:
    var invalid = Decimal("0") ** (-1)
except:
    print("Zero to negative power properly detected")
    
# Overflow detection and prevention
var max_val = Decimal.MAX()
try:
    var overflow = max_val * Decimal("2")
except:
    print("Overflow correctly detected")
```

### 7. Equality and Comparison Operations

```mojo
# Equal values with different scales
var a = Decimal("123.4500")
var b = Decimal("123.45")
print(a == b)  # True (numeric value equality)

# Comparison operators
var c = Decimal("100")
var d = Decimal("200")
print(c < d)   # True
print(c <= d)  # True
print(c > d)   # False
print(c >= d)  # False
print(c != d)  # True
```

### 8. Real World Financial Examples

```mojo
# Monthly loan payment calculation with precise interest
var principal = Decimal("200000")  # $200,000 loan
var annual_rate = Decimal("0.05")  # 5% interest rate
var monthly_rate = annual_rate / Decimal("12")
var num_payments = Decimal("360")  # 30 years

# Monthly payment formula: P * r(1+r)^n/((1+r)^n-1)
var numerator = monthly_rate * (Decimal("1") + monthly_rate) ** 360
var denominator = (Decimal("1") + monthly_rate) ** 360 - Decimal("1")
var payment = principal * (numerator / denominator)
print("Monthly payment: $" + String(round(payment, 2)))  # $1,073.64
```

## Objective

Financial calculations and data analysis require precise decimal arithmetic that floating-point numbers cannot reliably provide. As someone working in finance and credit risk model validation, I needed a dependable correctly-rounded, fixed-precision numeric type when migrating my personal projects from Python to Mojo.

Since Mojo currently lacks a native Decimal type in its standard library, I decided to create my own implementation to fill that gap.

This project draws inspiration from several established decimal implementations and documentation, e.g., [Python built-in `Decimal` type](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html), [Rust `rust_decimal` crate](https://docs.rs/rust_decimal/latest/rust_decimal/index.html), [Microsoft's `Decimal` implementation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.decimal.getbits?view=net-9.0&redirectedfrom=MSDN#System_Decimal_GetBits_System_Decimal_), [General Decimal Arithmetic Specification](https://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html), etc. Many thanks to these predecessors for their contributions and their commitment to open knowledge sharing.

## Nonmenclature

DeciMojo combines "Decimal" and "Mojo" - reflecting both its purpose (decimal arithmetic) and the programming language it's implemented in. The name emphasizes the project's focus on bringing precise decimal calculations to the Mojo ecosystem.

For brevity, you can refer to it as "deci" (derived from the Latin root "decimus" meaning "tenth").

## Status

Rome wasn't built in a day. DeciMojo is currently under active development, positioned between the **"make it work"** and **"make it right"** phases, with a stronger emphasis on the latter. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome! If you encounter issues, please [file them here](https://github.com/forfudan/decimojo/issues).

### Make it Work ‚úÖ (MOSTLY COMPLETED)

- Core decimal implementation exists and functions
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are implemented
- Type conversions to/from various formats work
- String representation and parsing are functional
- Construction from different sources (strings, numbers) is supported

### Make it Right üîÑ (IN PROGRESS)

- Edge case handling is being addressed (division by zero, zero to negative power)
- Scale and precision management shows sophistication
- Financial calculations demonstrate proper rounding
- High precision support is implemented (up to 28 decimal places)
- The examples show robust handling of various scenarios

### Make it Fast ‚è≥ (IN PROGRESS & FUTURE WORK)

- Core arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) have been optimized for performance, with comprehensive benchmarking reports available comparing performance against Python's built-in decimal module ([PR#16](https://github.com/forfudan/decimojo/pull/16), [PR#20](https://github.com/forfudan/decimojo/pull/20), [PR#21](https://github.com/forfudan/decimojo/pull/21)).
- Regular benchmarking against Python's `decimal` module (see `bench/` folder)
- Performance optimization for other functions is progressing gradually but is not currently a priority

## Tests and benches

After cloning the repo onto your local disk, you can:

- Use `magic run test` (or `maigic run t`) to run tests.
- Use `magic run bench` (or `magic run b`) to generate logs for benchmarking tests against `python.decimal` module. The log files are saved in `benches/logs/`.
